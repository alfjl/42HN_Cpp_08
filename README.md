# 42_Cpp_Module_08

The goal of the **C++ modules 00 to 08** is to introduce the student to Object-Oriented Programming and the C++ programming language in general.
Because of the complexity of the language, the students code has to comply with the C++98 standard.

**C++ module 08** introduces the learner to the C++ STL, specifically the Containers and Algorithms parts. The topics ara templated containers, iterators and algorithms.  
Even though all of the exercises could be solved WITHOUT the use of standard containers and algorithms, the goal is to use them as much as possible, to gain proficiency.

## Description

ex00:  
Write an 'easyfind' template accepting two parameters - a type T and an int. Assuming T is a container of integers, this function has to find the first occurrence of the second parameter (int) in the first (T).  
(easy dive into the STL with containers and iterators)

ex01:  
Develop a 'Span' class, able to store up to 'N' integers. Write an 'addNumber()' function, as well as a function adding a number of integers, and two functions returning the shortest and the longest span between between all numbers stored. Test with at least 10.000 numbers.  
(learn how to look into STL containers and search for specific functionalities)

ex02:  
The std::stack is one of the few containers, which are NOT iterable. Thus implement a 'MutantStack', which has all of the std::stack's features, but with the added bonus of iterators.
(deeper look into containers and iterators)

## Learnings

Very nice intro to the STL, and a great incentive to look deeper into the implementation of different STL containers.
